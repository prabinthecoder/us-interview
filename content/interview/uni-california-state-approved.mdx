**Me:** In the year 2023.

**VO:** What have you been doing since then?

**VO:** Just tell the subjects that you will study, like will you study Intro to Python or Java... what?  
**Me:** I really got confused. My heart was beating like a drum because I was getting too fumbled and feeling a sense of rejection because this was out of my knowledge. He was trying to confuse me and wanted to check my confidence. He was asking the same question 3 to 4 times. I was not getting this question. At last, I said, "Sorry officer, I can't understand your question," and then he replied, "Can't you just understand what I am saying or are you unable to hear what I am saying?" I replied, "Sorry officer, but I don't know about the subject you are asking."

**VO:** Ok, leave it. How did you know about this University?  
**Me:** One of my friends, who was my senior in high school, is currently studying at California State University East Bay and told me about the University, saying it is very great, the official day is nice and helpful, and the university regularly organizes events like hackathons and workshops that help us gain better knowledge. (Here, the VO looked angry, and his face showed disappointment with my answers.)

**VO:** How are you going to fund your education?  
**Me:** My father is going to fund my education.

**VO:** What does your father do?  
**Me:** He owns a real estate business.

**Me:** It is basically the sale and purchase of properties and (interrupted...).

**VO:** What type of properties? Just tell me, is it commercial or agricultural?  
**Me:** Officer, we deal in both, and also with agricultural land, and sometimes we lease property to make profitable assets.

**VO:** (The Visa Officer stopped asking questions and typed on his computer for 1 to 2 minutes, then said that he was keeping my passport.)  
**Me:** I was confused because I was not even 1% sure that I would get my visa because my answers and confidence were poor, but still, it was a lucky charm for me that I got the visa in this situation.

**VO:** Scene in the embassy  
**Me:** My time was 8:10, and there were a lot of people in front of me. The embassy had just opened, and the officers were just about to get to their seats. The interviews started, and I saw rejection after rejection, even for tourism visas or F1 visas. I saw everyone getting rejected.
